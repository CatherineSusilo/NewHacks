This file details the first iteration of the navigation bar

## Navigation bar

Add a navigation bar to the bottom of the app which contains two tabs: "videos" and "profile".

### Videos tab

The videos tab should show only the scrollable videos, the like button and the video timer.

The video timer should stop when you are in any other tab that is not video tab. ONLY resume it when in the videos tab.

### Profile tab

The profile tab should for now only contain the time history that the user has spent for a month. It should be a bar graph. The highest value of the bar graph should be min(the longest time the user has spent in hours, 2 hours).
