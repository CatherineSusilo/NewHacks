This file outline how time tracking should be implemented in the app.

### Goal

We want to be able to track how long a user watches the videos for each day. This time should be shown in the upper right corner. It should be in the following format: HH:MM:SS

This counter should reset every day. This counter should also be tracked. Keep a history of how long the user has watched videos for each day. Don't do anything with this history yet just keep a track of it in the code.

Remove the "Video x of y" counter shown in the top left of the reels feed.
