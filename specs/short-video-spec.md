This spec outlines how shorts should behave.

Currently there is a 15 limit to shorts. Remove this and instead make it so that they are unlimited.

Load the next few shorts (whichever works fastest) so that the user doesn't have to wait for the short to load.

Remove the "short x of y" counter in the top left of the screen.
