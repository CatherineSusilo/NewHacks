This file outlines how videos should behave in this app.

The main desired behaviour is that users should be able to scroll down and up to go through videos. There should also be a like button on the right hand side to like a video.

The user should also not be able to fast forward or slow down the video or seek through it. They should only be able to pause it by pressing down on the video. When they release the video should start playing again.

Users should be able to mute the video by simply pressing it and unmute the video by pressing again. There should be a small animation in the middle of the screen that shows that they either muted or unmuted the video.

Use the sample videos provided in the videos/ folder to create a demo for this feature.
